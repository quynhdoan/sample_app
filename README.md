# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Matter of Course

I use this project to learn Rails and have made a couple changes to the default settings:

+ Switched to SLIM from ERB (I previously used HAML, but decided to go with SLIM because its syntax is much cleaner.)
+ Switched to Postgresql from SQLite.
+ Switched to Bootstrap SASS 3 from Bootstrap SASS 2 (better support for responsive design)
+ Added support for Foundation 5 (In progress)
