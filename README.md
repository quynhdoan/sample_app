# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

I use this project to learn Rails and have made a couple changes to the default settings:

+ Switched to HAML from ERB.
+ Switched to Postgresql from SQLite.
+ Switched to Bootstrap SASS 3 from Bootstrap SASS 2 (better support for responsive design)
+ Added support for Foundation 5 (In progress)
